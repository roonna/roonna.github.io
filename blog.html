						<h1>The History of Boba Tea</h1>
						<p>
							Boba tea, also called "bubble tea" and "black pearl tea" is a drink invented in 1980s in Taiwan. There are many different variations but the classic version of Boba tea is a combination of tea, milk and the "Boba" -- which is a kind of ball made of tapioca.
						</p>
						<p>
							The roots of Boba can be traced back to the 1940s and a mixologist  Chang Fan Shu opened a tea shop selling unique hand-shaken tea made with cocktail shakers. The result was a rich and silky iced tea with fine air bubbles on top. Then in 1986, Tu Tsong decided to experiment with adding big, black tapioca balls to milk tea for a richer taste and chewier texture which became the classic Boba tea most people know and love today.

						<h1>What is Tapioca?</h1>
						<p>
							Tapioca (/ˌtæpiˈoʊkə/; Portuguese: [tapiˈɔkɐ]) is a starch extracted from the storage roots of the cassava plant (Manihot esculenta, also known as manioc), a species native to the north region central-west region of Brazil, and certain parts of West Africa[1] but whose use is now spread throughout South America. The plant was brought by the Portuguese to much of West Indies, Africa and Asia. It is a perennial shrub adapted to the hot conditions of tropical lowlands. Cassava copes better with poor soils than many other food plants.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although tapioca is a staple food for millions of people in tropical countries, it provides only carbohydrate food value, and is low in protein, vitamins and minerals. In other countries, it is used as a thickening agent in various manufactured foods.
